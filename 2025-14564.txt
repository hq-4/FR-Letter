SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[Release No. 34-103573; File No. SR-LCH SA-2025-007]


Self-Regulatory Organizations; LCH SA; Notice of Filing of 
Proposed Rule Change Relating to LCH SA's Risk Governance Framework and 
Collateral, Financial, Credit, Operational and Third Party Risk 
Policies

July 29, 2025.
    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(``Act''),\1\ and Rule 19b-4,\2\ notice is hereby given that on July 
15, 2025, Banque Centrale de Compensation, which conducts business 
under the name LCH SA (``LCH SA''), filed with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change, as 
described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared 
primarily by the clearing agency. The Commission is publishing this 
notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested 
persons.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).
    \2\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Clearing Agency's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the 
Proposed Rule Change

    LCH SA is submitting several risk policies (``Risk Policies'') 
which LCH SA has adopted, including: (i) the Collateral Risk Policy; 
(ii) the Financial Resource Adequacy Policy; (iii) the Counterparty 
Credit Risk Policy; (iv) the Operational Risk Management Policy; (v) 
the Third Party Risk Management Policy; and (vi) the Risk Governance 
Framework. The Risk Policies have been issued by LCH Group Holdings 
Limited (``LCH Group'') \3\ and adopted by the LCH SA Risk Committee 
and LCH SA Board.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ LCH Group Holdings Limited is an indirect wholly owned 
subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange Group plc. In addition to 
LCH SA, LCH Group also owns LCH Limited, a recognized central 
counterparty supervised in the United Kingdom by the Bank of England 
and a derivatives clearing organization (``DCO'') registered with 
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
    \4\ The Risk Policies have been elaborated in common with LCH 
Ltd. in order to ensure risk management consistency within LCH 
Group. Identical risk policies have been approved by LCH Ltd.'s 
governance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. Clearing Agency's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis 
for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, LCH SA included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the Risk Policies and discussed 
any comments it received on the Risk Policies. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. 
LCH SA has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, 
of the most significant aspects of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Risk Policies have been adopted by LCH SA in order to set out 
the specific risk management requirements that govern its operations as 
a clearing agency. Moreover, the Risk Policies clarify the roles and 
responsibilities within LCH SA for compliance with the Risk Policies. 
Finally, the Risk Policies have been designed to ensure consistency 
with all relevant laws and regulations, including the European Markets 
Infrastructure Regulation (``EMIR'') and Section 17A of the Act \5\ and 
the regulations thereunder.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ 15 U.S.C. 78q-1.
    \6\ The Risk Policies generally identify the relevant provisions 
of law and regulation applicable to that policy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

a. Collateral Risk Policy
    The Collateral Risk Policy (``CRP'') sets out the LCH Group 
standards for the management of collateral risk at LCH SA, subject to 
the risk appetite defined in the Risk Governance Framework. The goal of 
the policy is to ensure that LCH SA has a robust mechanism in place to 
process and control the collateral posted by its members.
    The CRP applies to collateral accepted by LCH SA to cover margin 
requirements and default fund contributions.\7\ The CRP also clarifies 
the roles and responsibilities within LCH SA for compliance with the 
CRP. The policy owner is the LCH SA Chief Risk Officer (``CRO''). In 
addition:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ Collateral accepted by LCH SA to cover risks associated with 
(i) securities accepted as part of the clearing services such as in 
RepoClear and Equity Clear; and (ii) secured cash investments 
(reverse repurchase agreements or outright purchases) conducted as 
part of CaLM's investment activities, are outside the scope of the 
CRP and are covered by the Financial Resource Adequacy Policy (see 
paragraph below) and Investment Risk Policy, respectively.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> LCH SA Collateral and Liquidity Management team (``CaLM'') 
has a number of responsibilities under the CRP. CaLM's primary 
responsibilities include: (i) daily monitoring of the pool of 
collateral lodged by its members in accordance with the policy; \8\ 
(ii) calibrating collateral haircuts and performing daily monitoring in 
accordance with the CRP; (iii) supervising the delegated team LCH Ltd 
First Line Risk RepoClear with the sourcing and assessment \9\ of 
collateral prices based on guidelines by CaLM First Line Risk SA, 
subject to the standards set out in the LCH Contract and Market 
Acceptability Policy; (iv) implementing collateral concentration limits 
on its members and monitoring against these on a daily basis; (v) 
handling general enquiries from members regarding collateral risk 
methodology; (vi) performing collateral stress testing in accordance 
with the CRP; and (vii) realizing the cash value of the collateral 
lodged by a defaulted

[[Page 36258]]

member during the Default Management Process (``DMP''); \10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ Such monitoring encompasses working with external 
stakeholders (e.g., International Central Securities Depositories 
(``ICSDs''), Central Securities Depositaries (``CSDs'')) and 
internal stakeholders (e.g., Collateral Operations, as defined 
below) to update the list of eligible collateral in line with the 
acceptance criteria set out in the CRP.
    \9\ For example, this includes assessing the prices of 
collateral lodged bilaterally and collateral lodged via tri-party 
providers against published market prices. In addition, it assesses. 
In addition, where a material change in the collateral market is 
identified, CaLM will escalate the issue to CaLM Risk (as defined 
herein) and LCH SA senior management.
    \10\ The governance of the DMP is laid out in the LCH Default 
Management Policy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> LCH SA Risk Collateral and Liquidity Risk Management team 
(``CaLM Risk'') is responsible for daily monitoring and managing risks 
associated with collateral activities and positions in line with the 
requirements of the CRP. This includes, inter alia, conducting 
independent assessments of the eligibility of collateral received and 
validating collateral haircuts in accordance with the policy; \11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ CaLM Risk is also responsible for: (i) the independent 
assessment of the prices of collateral lodged bilaterally and the 
collateral market value lodged via tri-party providers against the 
published market prices, in line with second-line risk 
responsibilities for pricing set out in the LCH Contract and Market 
Acceptability Policy; (ii) validating and monitoring the collateral 
concentration limits on members; and (iii) the production of regular 
reports and management information for circulation with LCHA Risk 
Department, CaLM, and senior management, including escalation if 
there are material changes in the market value, credit quality or 
liquidity of collateral lodged (bilaterally or via tri-party).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> LCH SA Collateral Operations team (``Collateral 
Operations'') is responsible for ensuring that member margin 
liabilities are covered with eligible non-cash collateral and/or cash 
and managing the corresponding margin and collateral flows and related 
investment flows. Most notably, Collateral Operations: (i) monitors 
securities settlement and interoperability account balances; (ii) 
tracks member requests to lodge and substitute collateral (seeking LCH 
SA Risk Department and CaLM Risk approval as necessary); (iii) oversees 
the system handling valuation of collateral lodged by members including 
the application of relevant haircuts; (iv) communicates to members 
changes in the population of acceptable collateral and haircuts; (v) 
handles general inquiries from members regarding member collateral 
pledged to cover margin requirements; and (vi) is responsible for 
static data, collateral pricing, and adding new ISINs approved as 
eligible collateral; \12\ and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ In addition, the CaLM team in Ltd is responsible for static 
data, collateral pricing, and adding of new ISINs approved as 
eligible non-cash collateral.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> LCH SA Compliance is responsible for notifying regulators 
of changes to collateral eligibility, limits and/or haircuts, where 
relevant.
    The CRP also sets out requirements for the approval of eligible 
cash and non-cash collateral. In particular, the CRP establishes that 
margin requirements can be covered by a mixture of cash and eligible 
non-cash collateral (i.e., traded securities and bank guarantees), 
subject to the criteria set out in the policy.
    In respect of `cash', LCH SA accepts EUR, GBP and USD \13\ as the 
primary currencies for margin cover and default fund contributions. 
Further, the policy requires default fund contributions to be met by 
cash \14\ in the primary currencies designated by each Clearing 
Service.\15\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ LCH SA also accepts other currencies, subject to the 
minimum criteria set out in the CRP, including that the currency is 
used for clearing in LCH SA, has been approved for use by LCH SA 
Credit Risk, can be invested in accordance with the Investment Risk 
Policy, and CaLM Risk can manage the exchange risk associated with 
the currency.
    \14\ Default fund contributions can also be met by collateral 
equivalent to cash in the case of default such as Central Bank 
Guarantees, where authorized by the LCH SA Rulebook.
    \15\ LCH SA currently maintains three separate Clearing 
Services: (i) CDSClear, which provides clearing services for credit 
default swaps; (ii) RepoClear SA, which provides clearing services 
in respect of repo and cash transactions on Euro-denominated 
government and supra-national debts across 13 markets (France, 
Italy, Spain, Germany, Belgium, Austria, Finland, Ireland, The 
Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Supranational), as 
well as a basket collateral service through the Euro GC+ clearing 
service; and (iii) DigitalAssetClear SA, which provides clearing 
services for cash-settled Bitcoin index futures and options 
contracts traded on GFO-X, an FCA-regulated, centrally-cleared 
multilateral trading facility dedicated to digital asset futures and 
options.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    With regards to non-cash collateral, the CRP limits the assets 
accepted as collateral to those with low credit, liquidity and market 
risks as required by SEC Rule 17ad-22(e)(5).\16\ Specifically, in 
respect of `traded securities,' the policy requires that all traded 
securities meet certain credit, liquidity and market risk requirements 
to be eligible as collateral for margin cover. For example, (i) the 
issuer must be reviewed and assigned an internal credit score (``ICS'') 
by LCH SA Credit Risk; (ii) the value of the securities must be 
established daily using observed prices obtained from published 
sources; (iii) the security must be in a currency that meets the 
minimum criteria set out in the CRP, and must be reviewed by LCH SA 
Credit Risk if such currency is not denominated in the domestic 
currency of the home country; (iv) the value of the shares can be 
established daily using observed prices obtained from published 
resources; (v) the CCP has the operational infrastructure in place to 
process the securities, market the positions, and apply appropriate 
haircuts; (vi) CaLM has the expertise and the operational capability to 
realize the value of the security in the event of a default, either 
directly or via contractual arrangements with a third party service 
provider; (vii) the CCP can hold and liquidate the securities without 
legal challenge; and (viii) there must be sufficient market liquidity 
available.\17\ The full list of traded securities that qualify as 
eligible non-cash collateral \18\ are set out in Appendix II of the 
CRP. In addition, the CRP provides a list of traded securities that are 
not eligible as collateral for margin cover, including perpetual 
bonds.\19\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ 17 CFR 240.17ad-22(e)(5).
    \17\ The policy provides that fixed income securities where the 
issuance size of a security is less than the minimum specified in 
Appendix III, CaLM will provide evidence of market liquidity to CaLM 
Risk and approval for eligibility will be required from the CRO (or 
the CRO's delegate). Examples of such an issuance size include 800 
mln for AUD and 5.5 bln for NOK.
    \18\ Such eligibility remains subject to the eligibility 
criteria for traded securities summarized above as well as to the 
margin collateral haircut schedules published on LCH SA's website.
    \19\ Other traded securities not eligible include (i) zero 
coupon bond types (excluding treasury bills); (ii) strips (including 
principal and coupon strips); (iii) securities issued by credit and 
financial institutions; and (iv) securities which are close to 
maturity, subject to specific corporate events, or have optionality.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In respect of `bank guarantees', the policy provides that central 
bank guarantees are eligible as collateral for margin cover if they are 
issued by central banks in countries that are approved for investments 
by CaLM. Commercial bank guarantees are not eligible.\20\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ Such investments must comply with the Investment Risk 
Policy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The CRP also addresses changes to collateral eligibility. It 
provides that, for new currencies and new issuers within an approved 
collateral type to be accepted as collateral, approval from the LCH SA 
Executive Committee (``ERCo'') is required.\21\ The ERCo also has the 
discretion to declare that eligible collateral is no longer 
acceptable.\22\ New types of collateral that pose new or novel risk 
features, or that require a change to existing risk controls, require 
(i) CaLM to submit such request to the ERCo and the LCH SA Risk 
Committee; \23\ (ii) the ERCo and the LCH SA Risk Committee to review 
such request; and (iii) the LCH SA Board to approve such request.\24\ 
If no changes are required to existing risk controls,\25\

[[Page 36259]]

CaLM Risk approval is sufficient. The CRP requires, where possible, 
that LCH SA provide a notice period to its clearing members to allow 
them sufficient time to adjust the portfolio of collateral lodged, 
provided that this will not impair LCH SA's financial resources nor 
liquidity position.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \21\ In addition, the CRP requires appropriate regulatory 
approval to be obtained prior to LCH SA accepting new currencies. 
The ERCo may also request that new issuers be reviewed by the LCH SA 
Risk Committee and approved by the LCH SA Board.
    \22\ Such decisions are made upon the recommendation of CaLM and 
CaLM Risk, following which the ERCo must notify the Risk Committee 
of its decision.
    \23\ The request must be accompanied by its rational and 
supporting documentation.
    \24\ Appropriate regulatory approval must also be obtained prior 
to LCH SA's acceptance of new collateral types.
    \25\ For example, adding new ISINs issued by sovereigns which 
LCH SA already accepts, provided that the ISINs meet the minimum 
eligibility requirements for non-cash collateral.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The CRP also establishes a framework for monitoring market, credit, 
concentration/liquidity, wrong way and FX risks (the ``Risks''). The 
Risks are covered by baseline haircuts, haircut add-ons, limits and/or 
price adjustments, detailed in the policy.\26\ The policy provides that 
the ability of LCH SA to realize the value of a piece of collateral 
lodged by its member within the assumed holding period is affected by 
the collateral's market liquidity and the size of the position to be 
liquidated. Details of and the rational for the holding period is 
detailed in Appendix I. In line with SEC Rule 17ad-22(e)(5), the 
framework aims to set and enforce appropriate conservative haircuts and 
concentration limits.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \26\ In addition, the CRP requires collateral haircuts to comply 
with the FRAP.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The policy provides that the ERCo may impose haircut add-ons and/or 
impose new limits or price adjustments on certain types of non-cash 
collateral based on their market liquidity, in particular, CaLM's 
ability to realize the value of the securities in the event of a 
default. In addition, the ERCo has the discretion to assess haircut 
add-ons on clearing members, based on their exposures, domicile, or 
portfolio of collateral posted, to protect LCH SA's financial resources 
and liquidity position. Collateral haircuts are subject to daily stress 
testing with any exceptions to be notified to the ERCo.\27\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \27\ Under the CRP, the Stress Resting Regime must include the 
following elements: (i) historical risk factor moves beyond the 
99.7% level; (ii) theoretical scenarios which are extreme but 
plausible are to be used to complement the historical scenarios and 
provide better coverage of the tail losses of collateral portfolios. 
To the extent that similar securities are cleared by LCH SA, the 
same stress test scenarios applied on the clearing positions may be 
used to stress test collateral haircuts.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The CRO is responsible for ensuring the review of collateral 
haircuts,\28\ and changes to published haircuts must be submitted to 
the ERCo for approval.\29\ Material changes, as agreed by the ERCo, are 
required under the CRP to be notified to the LCH SA Risk Committee. 
Changes are required to be notified to the regulators, where 
appropriate. In addition, the policy requires the appropriateness of 
the CRP to be reviewed by the ERCo and the LCH SA Risk Committee on an 
annual basis,\30\ and requires approval by the LCH SA Board.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \28\ With quarterly reviews to be submitted to the ERCo for 
approval; monthly reviews submitted to LCH SA CRO and/or the ERCo; 
and more frequent reviews where appropriate.
    \29\ Material changes (agreed by the ERCo) are to be notified to 
the LCH SA Risk Committee. Changes are required to be notified to 
the regulators where appropriate.
    \30\ In line with SEC Rule 17ad-22(e)(5), the sufficiency of 
collateral haircuts and concentration limits is performed no less 
than annually.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

b. Financial Resource Adequacy Policy
    The Financial Resource Adequacy Policy (``FRAP'') sets out the 
standards governing the assessment of financial resources (initial 
margins, margin add-ons and default funds) against the Latent Market 
Risks \31\ in clearing member portfolios at LCH SA. The FRAP also sets 
out the standards for addressing procyclicality in the risk frameworks 
and models used by the LCH CCPs. In particular, the FRAP (i) details 
the standards by which financial resources should be assessed against 
member exposures; \32\ (ii) details the holding periods to be used for 
each product in the assessment of margins, providing the justification 
for each; (iii) articulates the rules governing the use of economic 
offsets between products; (iv) presents the limit framework to be used 
in assessing clearing exposures to members for each Clearing Service 
and across Clearing Services; (v) details the standards to be used for 
reverse stress testing the financial resources held against member 
portions; (vi) details the standards to be used for ensuring that 
procyclicality concerns are appropriately addressed in the risk 
frameworks and models used by the LCH CCPs; and (vii) describes the 
requirements for services within LCH Ltd that offer tiered 
participation arrangements in accordance with the Tiering Risks 
described in the Risk Governance Framework. Finally, the FRAP states 
that the Board's appetite for Latent Market Risk and Procyclicality 
Risk is low. The policy requires LCH SA to impose, call, and collect 
margins at least daily on each day when its Clearing Services are open 
and operating in order to limit its credit exposures \33\ to its 
clearing members and, where relevant, from Central Clearing 
Counterparties (``CCPs'') with which it has interoperability 
arrangements.\34\ In addition, the policy sets out the LCH SA standards 
for initial margin, margin add-ons, intraday margins and variation 
margin.\35\ For example:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \31\ `Latent Market Risk' is defined in the Risk Governance 
Framework as the `risk that the exposure to a member's portfolio 
value increases due to the impact of changing market factors on the 
valuation of the portfolio'. This risk is described as latent, in 
that LCH SA is only exposed in the event of the member's default.
    \32\ This includes variation margins, initial margins, margin 
add-ons for liquidity risk, concentration risk, wrong way risk where 
appropriate, as well as the sizing and re-sizing of default funds.
    \33\ Such margins shall be sufficient to cover potential 
exposures that LCH SA estimates will occur until the liquidation of 
the relevant positions.
    \34\ The FRAP also requires LCH SA to assess a number of risks 
prior to entering into any interoperating arrangements. For example, 
legal risk arising from the link, including each party's rights and 
obligations, cross border legal issues, netting arrangements, 
enforceability of the LCH SA Rulebook, default procedures, 
collateral arrangements and dispute resolution.
    \35\ The standards for the calculation of variation margin 
depend on whether the price discovery takes place on a public venue/
exchange or the price is determined via the ``OTC'' market. For 
example: (i) for exchanges and venues where pricing is transparent, 
each Clearing Service must have a well-documented routine for price 
capture, price verification and data cleansing where required; (ii) 
for OTC products, the model used to price instruments for variation 
margin purposes must be subjected to an ``outputs'' review; (iii) 
all inputs to the model must have a documented process for data 
capture and data cleansing; and (iv) standards for adequate price 
sources and controls should be equivalent to those described in the 
Contract, Market and Acceptability Policy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Initial margin levels for each of LCH SA's Clearing 
Services must be calibrated to the 99.7% \36\ confidence level; \37\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \36\ The rationale for the 99.7% confidence level is detailed in 
Appendix 2 of the FRAP.
    \37\ The policy explains that such levels ensure that enough 
margins are held to cover the potential loss from any member 
(including the clients of that member) to the defined service 
confidence levels under normal market conditions, should LCH SA need 
to close out that member's portfolio within the holding periods 
prescribed by the policy. The FRAP also sets out a set of 
expectations surrounding initial margin. For example, any 
deterioration in backtesting results must be identified immediately 
and flagged to the CRO and/or the ERCo to assess whether mitigation 
actions are required.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Additional margins must be held (where appropriate) to 
cover member specific portfolio risk arising from both house and client 
activity of the following types: (i) concentration/liquidity risk; (ii) 
sovereign risk; (iii) wrong way risk; and (iv) counterparty credit 
risk; and
    <bullet> Each Clearing Service is expected to monitor margin levels 
intraday and to have the capacity to call for margin intraday should it 
be necessary to address any issues with member exposures.
    The FRAP also sets out the minimum governance standards applicable 
to LCH SA's default fund arrangements, including the requirement for 
all financial resources held by LCH SA (initial margins, additional 
margins, and the default funds) to meet the so-called

[[Page 36260]]

``cover-2'' standard, i.e. the potential losses from a close-out in an 
extreme event of the largest two (2) member portfolios and all clients 
of both of these members. Moreover, the policy details: (i) the order 
in which LCH SA must use its available resources to cover the losses 
from a defaulting member; \38\ (ii) the predefined stress regime \39\ 
to be used to identify `extreme but plausible' \40\ tail losses in each 
member portfolio beyond the applicable initial margin confidence level; 
and (iii) the Stress Test Loss Over Additional Margin (``STLOAM'') \41\ 
to be imposed on members in order to limit exposure by LCH SA to a 
single clearing member portfolio. The FRAP states that LCH SA applies a 
daily Clearing Limit on member exposures such that the STLOAM may not 
exceed 45% of the Default Fund for any member (the Daily Default Fund 
Additional Margin, or ``DDFAM'' threshold), and that should a member 
group breach the 45% limit, the excess amount must be called as DDFAM 
from that member group and such margin must be held until the member 
group's exposure falls back below the 45% limit.\42\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \38\ The order is as follows: (i) defaulter's own financial 
resources (initial margins, variation margins, additional margins, 
default fund contributions); (ii) the Clearing House `skin in the 
game'; (iii) the default fund contributions of the non-defaulting 
members; (iv) second layer of skin in the game where required by 
applicable regulation; (v) default fund assessments of the non-
defaulting members; (vi) service continuity and loss allocation 
mechanisms; and (vii) if the resources at this stage are still not 
enough to cover the losses, then a decision is made to either close 
or partially close (if applicable) the service and allocate the 
remaining losses, or raise more funds from the membership to 
continue the service.
    \39\ This includes Stress Test Loss Over Initial Margin (STLOIM) 
and default fund additional margin (DFAM) calculations, the 
frequency at which each default fund must be resized, and the 
prescribed Stress Testing Regime to be followed.
    \40\ The FRAP determines that a scenario is `plausible' if it 
has happened over the last 30 years.
    \41\ This term and some other capitalized terms in the FRAP are 
defined in the glossary found in Appendix 4 thereof.
    \42\ The 45% DDFAM threshold may be increased to up to 50% for 
members with certain ICS scores, when additional risk management 
tools are in place subject to ERCo approval and Risk Committee 
notification.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The FRAP states that each service is expected to monitor intraday 
margin levels and have the capability to call for margin intraday 
should it be necessary to address any issues with member exposure. In 
addition, each service must calculate daily variation margin and such 
standards for calculation differ depending on whether the price 
discovery takes place on a public venue/exchange or the price is 
determined via the OTC market.
    The FRAP provides, in addition, that offsets or reductions are 
allowed in the required margin, subject to certain conditions being met 
e.g., where the economic offset must be demonstrably resilient during 
stressed market conditions and must be subject to the stress test 
regime. The policy also sets the standards to be applied to sources of 
procyclicality and requirements that were set out in the former 
Procyclicality Policy.\43\ Specifically, the FRAP discusses how LCH SA 
manages the trade-off between increasing clearing member margins 
following a market stress event, with the potential resulting liquidity 
drain, which may be disruptive to the market. To address procyclicality 
risk, LCH SA will employ specific standards for each of its clearing 
services to comply with. This includes producing margin levels which 
avoid disruptive step changes in financial resources held, ensuring 
margin increases are driven by market pricing and not anticipatory of 
market movements and adequately estimating volatility to prevent the 
erosion of margin levels during quiet periods. The FRAP has a 
supplemental appendix that describes the key sources of procyclicality 
risk in more detail and specific considerations LCH SA will factor in 
to avoid procyclicality risk when assessing clearing members.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \43\ As part of its annual review process, LCH SA moved the 
contents of its Procyclicality Policy into the FRAP and 
decommissioned the Procyclicality Policy. Section 9 of the FRAP 
includes detail on how LCH SA manages procyclicality risk, including 
by assessing changes in margin requirements, collateral haircuts, 
Clearing Member credit scoring and how LCH SA may assess Clearing 
Members for additional default fund contributions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The FRAP sets out the limit framework for clearing exposures at the 
member and member group level, with the primary limit being that no one 
member or member group can use more than 45% of the default fund.\44\ 
For lower credit quality members (beginning at an ICS score of 5), 
there is a limit of 25% usage of the Default Fund, progressively 
decreasing to zero for a member with an ICS score of 8 or higher. 
Finally, the FRAP provides that LCH SA will monitor these limits daily 
for each member in each Default Fund.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \44\ This may be increased up to 50% for members which have an 
ICS of 1-4, for a given default fund, when additional risk 
management tools are in place to mitigate a decrease in the 10% 
buffer in financial resources held. This is subject to approval from 
the ERCo followed by a notification to the Risk Committee, and the 
approval from ERCo needs to be ratified annually. Any such increase 
in the threshold to 50% is not automatic and each clearing service 
will need to present and justify the request during the ERCo.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To address the risk of clearing members that also have exposure as 
CaLM counterparties, the FRAP establishes a concentration limit 
framework at the counterparty level. That is, the FRAP defines a 
Capital at Risk (``CAR'') amount for each member or member group which, 
together with the aggregate risk exposure of that member or member 
group, must not be greater than 30% of the entire LCH SA capital.
    The FRAP, in addition, requires LCH SA to run liquidity stress 
tests,\45\ collateral stress tests \46\ and exposure stress 
testing.\47\ The policy also describes LCH SA's Reverse Stress Testing 
Framework to ascertain the adequacy of financial resources held against 
member positions.\48\ A supplemental appendix also describes LCH SA's 
reverse stress testing and sensitivity analysis processes in accordance 
with SEC regulations. Specifically, the appendix states that LCH SA 
will conduct a comprehensive analysis of core stress testing scenarios, 
models, and underlying parameters and assumptions more frequently than 
the required monthly cadence when the products cleared or markets 
served display high volatility or become less liquid, or when the size 
or concentration of positions held by the participants increases 
significantly. The results of which will go through LCH SA's internal 
governance processes for the purposes of assessing the adequacy of and 
adjusting, as necessary, its margin methodology, model parameters, 
models used to generate clearing or guaranty fund requirements, and any 
other relevant aspects of its margin framework. In addition to its 
reverse stress testing processes, LCH SA will conduct a sensitivity 
analysis of its margin models and a review of its parameters and 
assumptions for back-testing on at least a monthly basis and consider 
modifications to ensure its back-testing practices are appropriate for 
determining the adequacy of margin resources. This may be performed 
more frequently than monthly during periods of time when the products 
cleared or markets served display high volatility or

[[Page 36261]]

become less liquid, or when the size or concentration of positions held 
by the participants increases or decreases significantly. LCH SA will 
bring the results of this analysis through internal governance in order 
to evaluate the adequacy of its margin methodology, model parameters 
and any other relevant aspects of its margin framework.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \45\ These stresses are detailed in the Liquidity Risk Policy 
and must be run daily and reviewed at least quarterly or when there 
is a sudden change in liquidity conditions.
    \46\ These stresses are described in the Collateral Risk Policy 
and must be run daily. Collateral haircuts must be reviewed at least 
quarterly.
    \47\ This is the stress testing regime carried out in the 
default fund sizing described above in the FRAP, which ensures that 
the ``cover 2'' standard is being met relative to extreme but 
plausible scenarios above the service initial margin confidence 
level. These stress tests must be run daily.
    \48\ The financial resources considered by the policy include 
all margin coverage, default funds and liquidity resources.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

c. Counterparty Credit Risk Policy
    The Counterparty Credit Risk Policy (``CCRP'') describes the 
standards by which LCH Group and its entities manage and assess 
counterparty credit risk via an ICS and limit frameworks to manage the 
risk. Moreover, the policy clarifies the roles and responsibilities 
within LCH SA for compliance with the CCRP. LCH SA Credit Risk is 
responsible for monitoring \49\ and managing counterparty credit risk. 
This includes: (i) assigning and maintaining the ICS; (ii) assigning, 
maintaining and monitoring the applicable limits under the policy; 
(iii) reporting to the responsible risk team of any change in the ICS 
which triggers actions under the CCRP and other LCH SA risk policies; 
and (iv) regular and ad-hoc reporting to other risk areas and senior 
management. The policy is owned by the CRO.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \49\ LCH SA Credit Risk is also required to escalate to the ERCo 
if any concerns are raised as a result of the factors listed in 
Annex I, regardless of whether it directly impacts the Implied ICS. 
For example, where a counterparty reports a change to its external 
rating letter category from A to BBB and vice versa.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The CCRP requires an ICS to be assigned to all clearing members and 
the sovereign of their country of risk (and that of their parent, if 
different); and all other counterparties, including intermediaries and 
countries which are subject to a minimum ICS as covered in other risk 
policies. The main scoring frameworks for each counterparty type are 
detailed in the ICS Frameworks Methodology Document (the ``IFMD'') and 
are subject to annual model validation.
    The CCRP and IFMD set out the factors to be used by LCH SA to 
assign an ICS \50\ and derive the Implied ICS \51\ for corporates 
(including banks, non-bank financial institutions and supranational 
entities), sovereigns (including ``Government Related Entities''), 
interoperating CCPs, pension funds, regulated funds, and insurance 
funds.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \50\ The frameworks assign an ICS between one (1) and ten (10), 
whereby one (1) represents low default probability in line with the 
AAA public ratings and ten (10) is equivalent to a defaulting 
counterparty.
    \51\ The ICS is calculated using quantitative and qualitative 
factors, which are also scored on a one (1) to ten (10) scale based 
on one or more metrics. Each factor is weighted and the sum of the 
weighted factors produces an ``Implied ICS''. The Implied ICS can be 
adjusted up or down to arrive at the ``Final ICS'' based on specific 
``Adjustment factors'' which capture: (i) third party guarantees or 
support; (ii) country risk: a sovereign ceiling applies to all 
corporates unless there is a demonstrated degree of diversification. 
Due to the high regulatory oversight, the country ceiling does not 
apply to interoperating CCPs; and (iii) specific reasons which make 
one of the factors over/under stated or particularly significant to 
dominate all other factors for the final score. The factors, metrics 
and adjustments are reviewed by the ERCo on at least an annual basis 
and independently validated in accordance with the Model Governance, 
Validation and Review Policy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The CCRP also requires all applicable counterparties, including 
``Dormant Sponsored Members,'' to be subject to a formal documented ICS 
assessment before on-boarding, and then at least once a year. 
Prospective clearing members and interoperating CCPs for all markets 
must meet the minimum entry ICS detailed in the policy.\52\ For 
example, Clearing Members, including Interoperating CCPs, must have at 
least an ICS five (5) rating.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \52\ All other counterparties must meet the minimum eligibility 
criteria detailed in the relevant LCH risk policies and Rulebooks.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The policy requires a Credit Assessment Review and ICS 
recommendation to be performed for all new clearing member 
applications, including the sovereign credit assessment and ICS 
recommendation of the prospective clearing member and its parent 
jurisdiction. The ERCo has the discretion to reject any member 
application regardless of the ICS assigned.
    The CCRP and Annex I thereof detail the exposure monitoring 
thresholds, limits and tolerances applied to each clearing member. This 
includes: (i) STLOAM plus Default Fund Contribution/Net Capital ratio; 
(ii) T-ratio; and (iii) credit tolerances. All thresholds are monitored 
daily, and LCH SA Credit Risk decide on any action to be taken when a 
breach has occurred.
    The CCRP also provides that the aim of additional margin is to 
ensure that as a clearing member's credit quality deteriorates to below 
its entry requirement, more resources are called progressively so that 
the stress losses are fully covered by eligible resources. Moreover, it 
ensures the relevant service confidence level, as detailed in the FRAP, 
continues to be met. Additional margin will be applied to house 
positions and, in general, additional margin will also be applied to 
client accounts.
    The CCRP provides that, where appropriate, LCH SA Credit Risk and 
the business line may agree to separate procedures to apply additional 
margin to client accounts on a discretionary basis. Such procedures may 
include an assessment of the ability of a client to port and its 
underlying credit quality. Such procedures need to be approved by the 
ERCo upon LCH SA Credit Risk's recommendation. If such discretion is 
applied, the LCH SA Risk Committee will be notified of the ERCo's 
approval and the rationale for the decision.
d. Operational Risk Management Policy
    The Operational Risk Management Policy (``ORMP'') sets out (i) the 
LCH Group Board's \53\ risk appetite and expectations for the 
management of operational risk (defined as the risk of loss arising 
from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or 
from external events); \54\ and (ii) the key features of the 
operational risk management framework for identifying, assessing, 
monitoring, mitigating and managing operational risk. The policy 
applies to all operations within LCH SA, including all LCH SA 
employees,\55\ regardless of the basis or term of their employment. The 
standards of the OMRP must also be applied where business functions are 
outsourced to third parties, including intra-Group.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \53\ In accordance with the Risk Governance Framework and unless 
otherwise stated, ``LCH Group Board'' refers to each respective 
Group entity board, including that of LCH SA, LCH Ltd. and SwapAgent 
Ltd.
    \54\ The policy acknowledges that regulations applicable to 
local entities may specify a more detailed definition of 
`operational risk'.
    \55\ An ``employee'' is defined as a permanent, temporary and 
contract member of staff, consultant and secondee, intern and any 
other such individual.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The ORMP clarifies and expands upon the roles and responsibilities 
within LCH SA for compliance with the ORMP. The LCH SA Board is 
responsible for: (i) determining risk appetite; (ii) overall compliance 
of the risk management framework; and (iii) ensuring that management 
maintains an adequate system of internal controls appropriate to LCH 
SA, and the risks to which it is exposed.\56\ Moreover, the ORMP 
details the three lines of defence model, as defined in the Risk

[[Page 36262]]

Governance Framework, operated by LCH SA:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \56\ The OMRP sets out the LCH SA Board's expectations, 
including that (i) risks be identified, assessed, monitored and 
managed in a proactive manner to minimize the impact to the LCH 
Group; (ii) risk assessments be carried out using the risk severity 
matrix contained in Annex A; and (iii) each operational risk be 
identified as either `outside appetite', `near limit (within 
appetite)' or `within appetite'. Where risks are assessed as near or 
outside appetite, or where control weaknesses are identified, the 
First Line of Defence must develop solutions and implementation 
plans with clear interim milestones to address the weaknesses and 
bring the risks back to within appetite. The policy requires issues 
and actions to be raised at least for all risks assessed as near or 
outside appetite.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> All services and functions responsible for business as 
usual and change activities are responsible for ensuring adherence to 
the ORMP and being accountable for identifying, assessing, monitoring, 
mitigating and managing operational risk \57\ (the ``First Line of 
Defence'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \57\ This includes responsibility for the day-to-day management 
of risk by designing, operating and maintaining an effective system 
of internal controls and for promoting the development of a strong 
risk culture. The ORMP provides that business and department heads 
are responsible for ensuring all material risks, controls and 
mitigating actions are up to date and reflect the current risk 
assessment. In addition, all staff are responsible for the day-to-
day management of risk by designing, operating and maintaining an 
effective system of internal controls.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> LCH SA Risk Department \58\ are responsible for (i) 
providing oversight, support, and challenge to the First Line of 
Defence; \59\ (ii) ensuring that the ORMP is aligned to the LCH SA 
Board's risk appetite; (iii) defining the risk management process and 
policy framework; (iv) assessing risks against policy standards; and 
(v) reporting to the Board and sub-committees on risk exposure (the 
``Second Line of Defence''). The Second Line of Defence is also 
responsible for providing appropriate training \60\ on the risk 
management framework at least annually to relevant staff.\61\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \58\ The LCH SA Risk Department is also responsible for 
approving all changes to appetite assessment, and reporting to the 
LCH SA Board and sub-committees on risk exposure.
    \59\ The Second Line of Defence must ensure that the First Line 
of Defence provides evidence of compliance with the principles and 
standards outlined in the ORMP in an appropriately frequent and 
detailed manner, having regard to the importance of the business and 
the services provided.
    \60\ In line with Annex D of the ORMP, LCH SA Compliance 
performs face-to-face training for new joiners on compliance topics, 
and at least every 2 years with critical staff. The purpose of risk 
management training is to (i) ensure the consistent application of 
the Operational Risk Management framework, including the tools and 
reporting processes; (ii) enhance the clarity of roles and 
responsibilities for risk management and embed these across the 
three lines of defense; and (iii) embed an effective risk culture 
for the group which maintains high standards or risk awareness, 
transparency and accountability.
    \61\ Compliance is also included as a Second Line of Defence, 
providing oversight, support and challenge to the First Line in 
addition to ensuring that this policy is aligned to the Board risk 
appetite and complies with all the applicable financial rules and 
regulations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> LCH SA Internal Audit team (``Internal Audit'') is 
responsible for developing and delivering a program of assurance aimed 
at validating that the control environment is operating in alignment 
with the LCH SA Board's risk appetite and the policies approved by the 
LCH SA Board (``Third Line of Defence'').\62\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \62\ In doing so, the Third Line of Defence provides independent 
assurance to the LCH SA Board and other key stakeholders over the 
effectiveness of the systems of internal controls and the Risk 
Governance Framework.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The ORMP requires the LCH Group to have a defined risk taxonomy for 
operational risks, as set out in Appendices 3 and 7 of the Risk 
Governance Framework (the ``Risk Taxonomy''). Specifically, (i) the 
First Line of Defence must identify applicable operational risks and 
define associated controls applicable to their business or function, in 
line with the Risk Taxonomy; and (ii) any changes must be approved by 
the Second Line of Defence, in accordance with Annex C of the ORMP.
    The policy confirms that the LCH SA risk assessment tools and 
processes must include the following minimum requirements:
    <bullet> risk and control assessments \63\ (``RCAs'') to be 
performed by the First Line of Defence \64\ on an annual basis, and 
reviewed by the Second Line of Defence; \65\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \63\ Such assessments must consider a number of factors such as 
(i) critical and significant audit findings; (ii) policy breaches; 
and (iii) external events that may give rise to increased 
vulnerabilities. Change activities (including new products, 
processes and system changes), which, if not deployed correctly 
would have a material impact on LCH SA's business activities or risk 
profile, must follow the defined change management process detailed 
in the ORMP and Annex E thereof.
    \64\ In carrying out its RCAs, the First Line of Defence must 
refer to the Risk Taxonomy and Control Guidance set in a dedicated 
Standard as set forth in the Risk Governance Framework in order to: 
(i) identify risks and controls which are applicable to their 
business or function; (ii) assess the inherent risk (i.e., before 
considering mitigating controls); (iii) perform a control 
environment assessment; and (iv) assess the residual impact and 
likelihood of the risk after considering the control assessment.
    \65\ The Second Line of Defence must have a process in place to 
review and challenge First Line of Defence RCAs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> a control assurance process,\66\ covering key controls 
\67\ in appropriate depth and frequency;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \66\ Control assurance is an assessment of controls by a person 
independent of the day-to-day operation of those controls to confirm 
the control environment is adequately designed and operating 
effectively, providing a systematic view of which controls are 
effective in mitigating risk, which ones are not and where controls 
are missing. The control assurance also focuses on providing 
objective evidence that key controls are designed and operating 
effectively. This provides management the opportunity to respond 
where controls are not managing risks sufficiently. For the purposes 
of this control framework, `control' is defined as `an action taken 
(including verification action) to mitigate risk by either reducing 
the likelihood and/or the impact of an unwanted outcome'.
    \67\ The term `key control' is defined as a control that 
`[p]revents a risk from materializing, detects it in a timely manner 
or significantly mitigates the consequences. The failure of the key 
control could have a material impact; financial, non-financial, 
reputational, regulatory, lead to service disruption and increase 
risk exposure for the entity'. Any key controls being assessed as 
being absent or ineffective must be reported to the Second Line of 
Defence with a remediation plan.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> deep dives \68\ to be conducted by the First, Second and 
Third Lines of Defence in response to concerns, themes, management 
focus, triggers or external drivers; and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \68\ Deep dives assess the controls and governance over a 
particular process. Any changes to risk profile or actions required 
as a result of a deep dive must be reported to Second Line of 
Defence, with a remediation plan.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> a list of extreme but plausible operational risk scenarios 
relevant to the business or function, incorporating expert opinion \69\ 
and data evaluating exposure to high severity events.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \69\ The ORMP provides that such scenario analysis should draw 
on the knowledge of experienced business managers and subject matter 
experts to derive reasoned assessments of plausible severe losses 
and impacts. As part of the RCA review, the Second Line of Defence 
will review and challenge the scenarios selected by First Line to 
ensure they are reflective of the key risks the business or function 
is exposed to. Over time, the ORMP requires such assessments to be 
validated and reassessed through comparison to actual loss 
experience to ensure their reasonableness.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The ORMP also details the process to be followed when the following 
risk events occur triggering a re-assessment of risks and controls: (i) 
incidents and actual losses; \70\ (ii) audit \71\ or risk and 
compliance issues, and external reviews; \72\ (iii) key risk and 
control indicator breaches; \73\ (iv) control weakness; (v) other 
internal events including process changes or restructuring; \74\ and 
(vi) external events arising outside of LCH SA and LCH

[[Page 36263]]

Group's control (e.g., natural disasters, pandemics, political changes, 
etc.).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \70\ A process must be in place to monitor and manage all types 
of incidents including IT system failures, failure or delays in key 
business processes, in order to minimize interruptions to business 
services. The ORMP requires all incidents to be classified in 
accordance with their materiality under Annex B and recorded in an 
appropriate system to facilitate the immediate escalation and 
resolution of the incident.
    \71\ Any audit issue rated `critical' or `significant' may 
impact the risk profile of the business/function and the risk must 
be re-assessed accordingly.
    \72\ External reviews can be initiated by LCH SA's regulators or 
management where a third party is engaged to perform a specific 
review and will include for example management recommendations 
arising as part of the annual external audit process.
    \73\ Key Risk Indicators (``KRI'') and Key Control Indicators 
(``KCI'') are metrics with thresholds designed for management to use 
in order to effectively identify, assess and monitor their current 
and emerging risks against risk appetite. All businesses and 
functions must implement them based on the operational risk library 
and control guidance.
    \74\ Changes such as process redesign or organizational 
restructuring may impact the risk profile and require re-assessment 
of relevant risks, as could a threat assessment triggered by senior 
management or the LCH SA Board.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Finally, the ORMP requires businesses and functions to maintain 
complete and accurate risk registers; risk indicators and evidence that 
supports the assessment of risk, including scenario testing, and ensure 
regular management information is available for reporting on the status 
of operational risk.
e. Third Party Risk Management Policy
    The Third Party Risk Management Policy (``TPRMP'') and the 
associated Standard set forth in the Risk Governance Framework set out 
LCH Group's minimum requirements for managing potential risks when 
entering into and managing all third party relationships across the 
following four (4) phases of the Third Party \75\ lifecycle: (i) 
identify the need to leverage third party services and select the most 
appropriate third party provider (``Plan and Select''); (ii) set the 
conditions for the third party relationship (``Contract and Onboard''); 
(iii) ensure that the service, relationship and risks are effectively 
managed (``Manage and Monitor''); and (iv) ensure orderly exit and 
transition at the completion of an engagement or an early termination 
(``Terminate and Exit'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \75\ ``Third Party'' is defined in the TPRMP to mean a third 
party entity, whether internal or external, that provides goods or 
services to LSEG. The definition includes: (i) External service 
providers (also known as suppliers and vendors) where LSEG negotiate 
contractual terms and pay through invoiced arrangements; (ii) 
External Partners including Financial Market Utilities (FMUs)/
Financial Market Institutions (FMIs)/Banks, etc. remunerated through 
indirect payments (e.g., settlements/deductions). These include 
CCPs; (iii) Internal Third Party: intragroup services provided from 
one LSEG entity to another. This definition does not include 
affiliates, charities, brokers, or joint ventures.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Plan and Select section explain how a Risk Assessment must be 
performed on all new Third Party engagements.\76\ Such assessment 
evaluates the importance and criticality of the third party 
dependencies across all dimensions and drives subsequent due diligence 
and procurement activities. Moreover, the policy requires due diligence 
conducted to be proportionate to the inherent risk and nature of the 
engagement prior to determining if the Third Party is an appropriate 
choice for LSEG and within the defined appetite, including 
concentration. Due diligence must include, but is not limited to, 
business facts,\77\ know your third party,\78\ due diligence \79\ and 
conflicts of interest.\80\ The TPRMP provides a detailed list of the 
events that trigger notification to the relevant regulators e.g., when 
an existing arrangement turns from `non-critical' to `critical', and 
when there are changes \81\ to the list of existing Critical 
Outsourcing Arrangements.\82\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \76\ In the event of a ``Critical Outsourcing'' arrangement, 
appropriate risk and LCH SA Board approval, including regulated 
entity boards, must be obtained prior to execution, including for 
the use of any subcontractors. In addition, where a third party 
provides details on its extended supply chain, LCH SA should 
establish if any of those parties meet the definition of `critical'. 
Where identified, these should be managed in line with the relevant 
requirements in the TPRM Standards. `Extended Supply Chain' is 
defined as `Equivalent to 4th and nth suppliers. Aligns with the 
expectation that entities take steps to understand critical 
dependencies in their extended supply chain as far as they extend 
into the supply chain'. Moreover, Appendix D of the TPRMP provides 
that where LCH SA identifies an FMI, FMU or other entity directly 
regulated by a competent authority (regulator) as `critical', the 
requirements of this policy and the associated TPRM standards will 
be applied on a best endeavors basis.
    \77\ For example, a check to ascertain that the Third Party is a 
valid entity registered in the jurisdiction(s) in which it operates 
and/or a check of the Third Party's capability to deliver the 
desired goods/services.
    \78\ For example, compliance and financial crime screening, 
including sanctions, anti-bribery & corruption, anti-money 
laundering, country risk and fraud, as appropriate.
    \79\ The TPRMP provides that such due diligence is to be carried 
out in accordance with the risk profile of the service, e.g., 
information and cyber security, data privacy, financial crime, and 
business continuity/resilience.
    \80\ All conflicts of interest relating to each third party 
arrangement must be identified, captured and managed in line with 
the Group Conflict of Interest Policy.
    \81\ This would include material changes, exits or replacements.
    \82\ A ``Critical or Important Outsourcing Arrangement'' is 
defined as a Third Party arrangement which meets both the definition 
of `Outsourcing' and delivers services which meet the definition of 
`Critical Service'. Outsourcing is defined as an engagement of any 
form between LSEG and a service provider by which that service 
provider performs a service, function or an activity that would 
otherwise be undertaken by LSEG itself. A sub-set of Third Party 
provided services (either internal or external) where certain 
regulatory requirements are triggered based on the type and 
materiality of the service. Example regulatory requirements include 
increased governance, more frequent risk assessment and regulatory 
notification. The policy lists the circumstances and factors to be 
considered by LCH Group to deem a service a `Critical Service'.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Contract and Onboard section requires LCH SA to have 
appropriate written agreements \83\ with the Third Party (including 
Intragroup engagements) that are commensurate with the nature, scale 
and complexity of the services and in line with the financial approval 
policy. The TPRMP also provides that the written agreement must 
consider the dependencies from the third party across all dimensions 
including technology and the potential impact on the continuity and 
availability of financial services and activities.\84\ In addition and 
for engagements or Outsourcing contracts with Critical Third 
Parties,\85\ the TPRMP requires LCH SA to engage with subject matter 
experts from Legal, the Business, Risk and Compliance during the 
contracting phase and the subsequent approval process.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \83\ A Written Agreement is defined as a binding, auditable 
commitment between LSEG, or an LSEG entity and a Third Party. It 
includes, but is not limited to, contracts, LSEG Legal preapproved 
standard Master Service Agreements (``MSA'') or other type of 
framework agreement along with Purchase Orders (``PO''), Statements 
of Work (``SoW''), Order Forms (``OF''), Access or Membership 
Agreement.
    \84\ The TPRMP requires written arrangements related to critical 
outsourcing or critical services to ensure the service provider 
grants LSEG and its competent authorities certain access (e.g., head 
offices and operation centers) and rights of inspection and 
auditing, to enable them to monitor such outsourcing arrangement, 
and to ensure compliance with all applicable regulatory and 
contractual requirements. Where the outsourcing of services is not 
critical, LCH Group should ensure the access and audit rights are 
appropriate taking a risk-based approach. The policy lists the 
circumstances and factors to be considered by LCH Group to deem a 
service a `Non-Critical Service'.
    \85\ A Critical Third Party is defined in the TPRM as a Third 
Party where the continuous, secure and efficient delivery of their 
services to the regulated entity is critical to the operation of 
that regulated entity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Manage and Monitor \86\ section requires an updated register of 
all current relationships with the third parties and outsourcing 
arrangements \87\ to be regularly maintained. Moreover, Third Party 
performance,\88\ together with that of any permitted subcontractors 
\89\ (for example 4th and nth parties) supporting the delivery of 
services, must be monitored \90\ on an

[[Page 36264]]

ongoing basis using a risk-based, proportionate approach \91\ and in 
line with the TPRM Manage and Monitor Standard to ensure the Third 
Party is delivering on their obligations under the written agreement. 
The policy also requires LSEG to exercise and apply audit rights (and 
supplier testing) in full to Critical Third Party arrangements and on a 
risk-based basis to non-critical outsourcing arrangements where 
required.\92\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \86\ The TPRMP provides that the following key principles 
underpin LSEG's approach to the management of Third Party 
arrangements: (i) a risk-based approach, with the highest level of 
oversight and due diligence on Critical Third Party services (which 
includes third parties which meet the regulatory definitions 
Critical Outsourcing Arrangements and Critical Third Parties); (ii) 
overall accountability by the Accountable Executive for overall 
resilience and any risks associated with it and for any activities 
conducted via an outsourcing arrangement; and (iii) standard 
processes and tools must be leveraged wherever possible to achieve 
consistency and efficiency.
    \87\ This includes critical 4th and nth parties where details of 
these are provided.
    \88\ The TPRMP sets out what the performance monitoring for 
Critical Third Parties should include. For example, Day-to-day 
monitoring of the Third Party's performance and delivery against the 
measures defined in the written agreement and to ensure appropriate 
action is taken to resolve any operational issues that may arise 
with the Third Party.
    \89\ A subcontractor is defined as a provisioning party to whom 
the Third Party subsequently delegates all or part of the provision 
of a service (e.g., 4th+ party).
    \90\ Monitoring of Third Party arrangements must also include 
the appropriate assessment and management of changes to, and within, 
the arrangement in line with organizational change processes. 
Moreover, the policy provides that it is important that Business 
Continuity Plans and reviewed and where relevant testing in line 
with the Business Continuity Management Policy.
    \91\ Further detail on this approach can be found in the TPRMP 
and Appendix D thereto.
    \92\ For regulated areas, this may include third party 
certifications and pool audits, where appropriate. A full table of 
requirements is set out in the Risk Methodology document.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Termination and Exit section requires LCH SA to plan for both a 
`stressed' (e.g., a third party becoming insolvent) and unstressed 
(e.g., termination for convenience/end of a contract) exit from each of 
its third party arrangements.\93\ The policy states that the 
Accountable Executive \94\ and Relationship Owner \95\ for each Third 
Party arrangement is responsible for ensuring records and documentation 
are maintained in line with local regulatory records management 
requirements, in order to demonstrate ongoing compliance with the TPRMP 
and the associated standards.\96\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \93\ Irrespective of the reason for exiting a Third Party 
relationship, LSEG aims to do so: without undue disruption to its 
business activities with minimal impact on the services provided to 
customers; and without limiting its compliance with legal or 
regulatory requirements.
    \94\ An Accountable Executive is defined as responsible for 
ensuring that the risks associated with the Third Party are managed 
as per this policy: (i) retain overall responsibility for the Third 
Party engagement; (ii) monitor Third Party engagement: (iii) manage 
incidents and disputes and oversee change control process'.
    \95\ A Relationship Owner is defined as a nominated individual 
within the Business Function who assumes responsibility for the 
ownership of goods or services from a designated Third Party. They 
are responsible for implementing and executing oversight and 
management activities across the Third Party lifecycle (i.e., from 
selection, contracting and onboarding service delivery through to 
exit activities). This role is limited to full time employees.
    \96\ The policy sets out the relevant LCH Group policies and 
guidelines, or equivalent entity policies and guidelines, that must 
be read in conjunction with the TPRMP. For example, the Anti-Bribery 
and Corruption Policy, the Business Continuity Policy, the Code of 
Conduct and Ethics, and the Conflicts of Interest Policy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The TPRMP also sets out the roles and responsibility for 
implementing the above standards within LCH SA.\97\ In this regard, LCH 
Group follows a third lines of defense model. The first line of 
defense, made up of the LCH SA Third Party Management Risk team and 
Procurement team, is responsible and accountable for identifying, 
assessing, monitoring, and managing third party risk. Moreover, it must 
ensure there are appropriate controls designed, implemented and 
assessed to ensure LCH SA can operate within the agreed risk appetite.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \97\ Further detail on these roles and responsibilities can be 
found in Appendix E of the TPRMP. Please note that Appendix A has 
not been referred to as it is not applicable to LCH SA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Second Line of Defence, including Second Line Risk and 
Compliance team, is responsible for the oversight, support, and 
challenge in addition to ensuring that the policy is aligned to the LCH 
SA Board appetite.\98\ The Third Line of Defence, made up of the 
Internal Audit function, is responsible for developing and delivering a 
program of assurance aimed at validating that the control environment 
is operating in alignment with the LCH SA Board's risk appetite and the 
policies approved by the LCH SA Board. In doing so, Third Line of 
Defence provides independent assurance to the LCH SA Board and other 
key stakeholders over the effectiveness of the systems of controls and 
the Risk Governance Framework.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \98\ The Second Line of Defence, including Compliance, must 
ensure that the First Line of Defence provides evidence of 
compliance with the principles and requirements outlined in this 
policy in an appropriately frequent and detailed manner, having 
regard to the importance of the business and the services provided.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

f. Risk Governance Framework
    The Risk Governance Framework (the ``RGF'') identifies the Key 
Risks (as defined below) faced by LCH SA and sets out: (i) the LCH SA 
Board's appetite across the Key Risks; (ii) the taxonomy of the Key 
Risks; (iii) the roles and responsibilities within LCH SA for managing 
each identified Key Risk; (iv) the standards to be met by LCH SA when 
managing its business activities within the determined risk appetite; 
and (v) the indicators and tolerance thresholds by which each Key Risk 
is meant to be measured and reported.
    The RGF aims to ensure that the risks assumed in executing LCH SA's 
business strategy are adequately understood and managed across all 
levels within LCH SA. Moreover, the framework supports LCH SA's Board 
and Executive Management in discharging their regulatory and corporate 
responsibilities.\99\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \99\ The RGF provides that this is done through robust 
governance arrangements with (i) well-defined, transparent, and 
consistent lines of responsibility; (ii) effective processes to 
identify, manage, monitor and report the risks to which it is or 
might be exposed; and (iii) adequate internal control mechanisms.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The RGF establishes a hierarchical risk taxonomy comprising of 
levels zero (0), one (1) and two (2). The key risks are set out at 
level zero (0) and include: (i) financial and model risks associated 
directly with clearing activities; (ii) risks relating to operational 
resilience; (iii) strategic risks; (iv) people and culture risks; and 
(v) regulatory compliance, legal and corporate disclosure risks 
(together, the ``Key Risks''). Within the Key Risks, the RGF identifies 
31 level one (1) risks, and a number of level two (2) sub-risks where 
additional granularity is appropriate.\100\ Moreover, the framework 
provides that LCH SA's appetite for the Key Risks is generally 
low,\101\ and in some cases, very low, due to its core mission as a 
regulated clearing house that plays a vital role in ensuring the 
stability of the financial markets in which it operates.\102\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \100\ Details on the taxonomy with level two (2) risk 
definitions can be found in Appendix 3 of the RGF.
    \101\ The framework establishes four levels of risk appetite: 
very low, low, medium and high. Moreover, each level is defined as 
follows: (i) `very low' means LCH SA is not willing to accept risks 
in most circumstances. The LCH SA Board should decide if the 
benefits outweigh the costs and the risk is worth taking; (ii) `low' 
means LCH SA is willing to accept risk in some circumstances whereby 
successful delivery is likely with an acceptable level of reward. 
Such risks should be managed at business unit level (as set out in 
the RGF), but escalated if the impact and/or probability of 
occurrence is increasing; and (iii) `moderate' means LCH SA is eager 
to innovate or choose options based on potential higher rewards. 
Risks in the `moderate' category should be monitored in accordance 
with the RGF to ensure that the cost/effort applied in managing such 
risks is appropriate given the potential downside. In relation to 
the `high' risk appetite, the framework provides that while LCH SA 
does not expect to have a high-risk appetite for any risk, in 
exceptional circumstances, it may temporarily tolerate short periods 
of exposure to this risk level.
    \102\ Section C of the RGF expands upon each of the risks 
identified in the risk taxonomy, including the relevant risk 
appetite, a definition of each risk, the high level standards 
expected to be in place to manage such risks, as well as the 
relevant risk indicators and associated tolerance thresholds for 
assessing the management of each risk.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The RGF also identifies a range of quantitative and qualitative 
indicators and thresholds \103\ tailored for specific risks, which are 
used to measure the extent to which a risk is considered within the LCH 
SA Board's appetite.\104\ In addition to these indicators, the CRO, as 
owner of the RGF, will utilize the risk assessment grid \105\ and 
process to

[[Page 36265]]

compile LCH SA Board's appetite reports.\106\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \103\ The framework provides that the thresholds should be 
considered risk tolerances (i.e., an `outside' appetite threshold 
indicates the maximum tolerance for a particular risk). The LCH SA 
Board expects that such tolerance levels should be specific to each 
risk, and capable of quantitative measurement where possible, so 
that an accurate report can be made of the status of each risk 
against the LCH SA Board's appetite and maximum tolerance.
    \104\ The CRO will include these indicators and thresholds in 
his regular risk reporting to the LCH SA Board.
    \105\ The assessment of a risk being reported as `within' 
(green), `near' (amber), or `outside' appetite (red) may be made by 
using the risk indicators described above and by comparing residual 
risk severity with the LCH SA Board's appetite, using the tables 
detailed in Section A3 and Appendix 6 of the RGF.
    \106\ The CRO may exercise judgement, both in the method 
utilized and in the final assessment e.g., taking into account the 
existence of any appetite-related actions. The CRO's assessment will 
be validated through review at the Resilience Committee (ResCo) and 
the ERCo.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The framework highlights that risk culture is a vital element of 
the overall culture of the LCH SA organization. LCH SA values, as 
adopted by the LCH SA Board and Executive Management, communicated to 
all employees, and reflected in the LSEG Code of Conduct, provide the 
basis for measuring and assessing LCH SA's culture, and support the 
measurement of risk against appetite. For example, the RGF requires (i) 
senior management and employees at all levels to operate in a 
transparent way, and be held accountable for their behavior; \107\ and 
(ii) mandatory training to be provided to employees to reinforce LCH 
SA's key cultural, behavioral, legal and regulatory obligations across 
all important topics.\108\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \107\ The RGF provides that the culture of transparency and 
accountability is embedded through establishing, monitoring and 
adhering to risk appetite, which is implemented through the 
framework and suite of LCH SA policies.
    \108\ The training is refreshed and rolled out throughout the 
year, requiring an assessment to be completed by all the staff to 
confirm that the materials have been understood. Non-completion is 
monitored and escalated to ensure that the training has been 
delivered to all intended recipients.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The framework requires LCH SA to follow the three lines of defense 
model (as described above). Like the ORMP,\109\ LCH SA Function Heads 
and Business Heads (excluding the CRO, LCH SA Chief Compliance Officer 
(``CCO'') and Head of Internal Audit) manage the risks of all LCH SA's 
business activities and therefore constitute the First Line of Defence. 
The CRO,\110\ as part of the Second Line of Defence, is responsible 
for: (i) measuring, monitoring and reporting the risks identified in 
the RGF and ORMP; and (ii) setting policies \111\ consistent with the 
standards identified in the RGF. LCH SA Human Resources, Compliance, 
Finance and Legal are responsible for corporate risks and for setting 
policies consistent with the RGF and for the management, monitoring and 
reporting of any policy noncompliance within their specific areas. 
Internal Audit is the Third Line of Defence.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \109\ The RGF details a specific Operational Risk Taxonomy in 
Appendix 7 thereof.
    \110\ The CRO has a dual reporting line to the LCH SA Chief 
Executive Officer (``CEO'') and to the Chair of the LCH SA Risk 
Committee. For compliance and regulatory risks, the CCO is 
responsible for the second-line risk function, supported by the CRO.
    \111\ The full list of LCH SA's Risk Policies can be found in 
Appendix 4 of the RGF.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The RGF details, in table format, each of the Key Risks, including: 
(i) the LCH SA Board's risk appetite and standards; (ii) relevant risk 
indicators and tolerance thresholds to assist with the assessment of 
whether each risk should be assessed as `within', `near' or `outside' 
appetite; \112\ (iii) the internal LCH SA stakeholders responsible for 
each risk and associated policy; and (iv) the LCH SA policy detailing 
how the LCH SA Board standards are applied across the business.\113\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \112\ Holistically, at each level, such risk status assessment 
will also take account of qualitative factors, tolerance thresholds, 
policies and culture.
    \113\ Such details can be found in Section C of the RGF.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In relation to reputational risk, the framework:
    (i) defines reputational risk as ``the risk of a failure to meet 
stakeholders' expectations or the risk of unfavorable public 
perceptions of the LCH SA business and brand;''
    (ii) identifies stakeholder perceptions, brand risk and media 
engagement as level two (2) risks;
    (iii) describes the LCH SA Board risk appetite as `low' and 
expresses that LCH SA will actively protect its brand by maintaining 
the integrity of services and actively review initiatives to ensure 
that its brand is protected;
    (iv) defines the CEO and Business Heads as the First Line of 
Defence, and the CRO as the Second Line of Defence;
    (v) states that this risk is covered by brand, media and 
communication policies;
    (vi) identifies `negative/damaging press coverage' as a risk 
indicator;
    (vii) identifies `up to three (3) days of national/``trade'' press 
coverage' as the near appetite threshold; and
    (viii) identifies `more than three (3) days of national/``trade'' 
press coverage as a proxy for maintaining a good reputation' as the 
outside appetite tolerance limit.
    Appendix 1 of the RGF details additional standards in relation to 
the subject of recovery, resolution and wind-down \114\ (``RRW'') and 
Important Business Services. For example and in relation to RRW, the 
framework requires LCH SA to have a pre-arranged recovery plan which: 
(i) has been agreed with LCH SA clearing members and regulators; (ii) 
has been fully documented and gone through the appropriate internal 
governance; (iii) lists the recovery tools available to be used in the 
recovery process; and (iv) lists the decision points which trigger LCH 
SA to go into recovery mode.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \114\ Appendix 1 of the RGF defines such risk as ``The risk 
stemming from LCH Ltd. or LCH SA not having in place a proper 
[r]ecovery [p]lan having identified and pre-agreed recovery tools to 
handle a loss event, remain solvent and to continue to operate 
smoothly in performing its central clearing role. Examples of such 
recovery tools can include member assessments, variation margin 
haircutting, cash settlement, etc.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The RGF is reviewed and signed off by the LCH SA Board at least 
annually, providing assurance that all risks continue to be 
appropriately identified and mapped, that the statement of risk 
appetite is clear and defined at the appropriate level of granularity, 
that ownership and responsibilities are clear, and that there is an 
appropriate process for monitoring and reporting on all risks against 
LCH SA's appetite.
2. Statutory Basis
    LCH SA has determined that the Risk Policies are consistent with 
the requirements of Section 17A of the Act \115\ and regulations 
thereunder applicable to it, including Commission Rule 17ad-22(e).\116\ 
In particular, Section 17A(b)(3)(F) \117\ of the Act requires, inter 
alia, that the rules of a clearing agency ``promote the prompt and 
accurate clearance and settlement of . . . derivatives agreements, 
contracts, and transactions'' and ``to protect investors and the public 
interest.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \116\ 17 CFR 240.17ad-22(e).
    \117\ 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3)(F).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In this regard, the CRP sets out more clearly LCH SA's standards 
for the management of risks associated with LCH SA's collateral 
activities, including collateral accepted to cover margin requirements 
and to satisfy default fund contributions. The policy establishes 
robust criteria for collateral eligibility, including concentration 
limits, as well as a rigorous oversight and monitoring framework to 
ensure that collateral is appropriately valued on an ongoing basis. In 
addition, the FRAP establishes a robust framework to ensure that the 
financial resources held by LCH SA against member exposures--including, 
most importantly, margin requirements--is sufficient to cover any 
potential losses of a defaulting clearing member. Insufficient 
financial resources, including margin, would impede LCH SA's ability to 
promptly accept trades for clearing, hence the CRP and FRAP are 
consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act.\118\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \118\ 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3)(F).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The CCRP is designed to identify, and manage, LCH SA's counterparty 
credit risk, principally through the ICS framework applicable to 
members and

[[Page 36266]]

the sovereign of their country of risk (as well as their parent entity, 
if different) as well as to all other investment and other 
counterparties. Applicants for clearing membership must meet a minimum 
ICS; a member's ICS is monitored on an ongoing basis and the policy 
sets out a framework for responding to deteriorating credit risk. The 
CCRP is therefore an integral part of LCH SA's arrangements to mitigate 
the risk of a clearing member default, which serves to protect 
investors as well as the public interest. The CCRP is therefore 
consistent with the requirements of Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the 
Act.\119\

    To clear trades promptly and accurately, LCH SA must ensure that 
its systems, including those operated by third parties, are resilient. 
In this regard, the ORMP sets out LCH SA's arrangements for minimizing 
the risks of disruption to LCH SA's services and to LCH SA's ability to 
carry out its obligations to members, clients and other stakeholders. 
The ORMP therefore implements a suite of risk assessment controls and 
procedures, including a control framework, deep dive, and scenario 
analysis, to address operational risks. These arrangements are 
supported by a change control framework as well as a set of procedures 
to undertake an ex-post review of risk incidents. The TPRMP is designed 
to manage the risks of using third party service providers in relation 
to outsourcing critical or important functions. By establishing a risk 
control framework across the outsourcing life-cycle--from contracting/
onboarding, to monitoring and managing performance, to exit/
termination--the TPRM minimizes the risks that the use of third party 
service providers will impact LCH SA's ability to accept trades for 
clearing promptly and accurately. The ORMP and the TPRMP are therefore 
consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act.\120\

    The RGF sits above the CRP, FRAP, CCRP, ORMP and TPRMP, and 
identifies the key risks faced by LCH SA as well as the associated 
indicators and tolerance thresholds by which each such risk is to be 
measured and reported. By providing the wider risk governance framework 
within which the CRP, FRAP, CCRP, ORMP and TPRMP have been designed and 
adopted, the RGF supports how such risk policies facilitate the prompt 
and accurate settlement of transactions and protect investors and the 
public interest and is therefore consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) 
of the Act.\121\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \121\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Commission Rule 17ad-22(e)(2)(i) provides that each covered 
clearing agency must establish, implement, maintain, and enforce 
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide for 
governance arrangements that are clear and transparent.\122\ As 
discussed above, each of the Risk Policies expands on and clarifies the 
standards by which LCH SA manages the various risks to which it is 
exposed as a CCP. Importantly, each Risk Policy clearly describes the 
roles and responsibilities of the various units within LCH SA or LCH 
Group, as applicable, responsible for compliance with each policy. For 
example, the CCRP specifies that LCH SA Credit Risk is responsible for 
monitoring and managing counterparty credit risk, including: (i) 
assigning and maintaining the ICS; (ii) assigning, maintaining and 
monitoring the applicable limits under the policy; (iii) reporting to 
the responsible risk team of any change in the ICS which triggers 
actions under the CCRP and other LCH SA risk policies; and (iv) regular 
and ad-hoc reporting to other risk areas and senior management. The 
CCRP also identifies the CRO as policy owner.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \122\ 17 CFR 240.17ad-22(e)(2)(i).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Similarly, the three lines of defense model set out in the TPRMP 
identifies the first line of defense as the LCH SA Third Party 
Management Risk and Procurement team Function Heads and Business Heads, 
which is responsible and accountable for identifying, assessing, 
monitoring, and managing third party risk and for ensuring that LCH SA 
can operate within the agreed risk appetite. Second Line Risk is 
responsible for the oversight, support, and challenge in addition to 
ensuring that the policy is aligned to the LCH SA Board risk appetite. 
The Internal Audit function, as the third line of defense, is 
responsible for developing and delivering a program of assurance aimed 
at validating that the control environment is operating in alignment 
with the LCH SA Board's risk appetite and the LCH SA Board's approved 
policies. For its part, the RGF specifies the internal LCH SA 
stakeholders responsible for each Key Risk and the associated policy 
framework generated to address such Key Risk.
    By expanding on and clarifying the standards by which LCH SA 
manages the various risks to which it is exposed as a CCP and more 
clearly describing the roles and responsibilities of the various units 
within LCH SA or LCH Group responsible for compliance with each Risk 
Policy, the Risk Policies provide for governance arrangements that are 
clear and transparent. As such, the Risk Policies are consistent with 
Commission Rule 17ad-22(e)(2)(i).\123\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \123\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Commission Rule 17ad-22(e)(2)(v) \124\ provides that each covered 
clearing agency must establish, implement, maintain, and enforce 
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to specify clear 
and direct lines of responsibility. As discussed in detail immediately 
above, each Risk Policy clearly describes the roles and 
responsibilities of the various units within LCH SA or LCH Group 
responsible for compliance with each policy. By more clearly describing 
the roles and responsibilities of the various units within LCH SA or 
LCH Group, as applicable, responsible for compliance with each Risk 
Policy, the Risk Policies specify clear and direct lines of 
responsibility. As such, the Risk Policies are consistent with 
Commission Rule 17ad-22(e)(2)(v).
    Commission Rule 17ad-22(e)(3) \125\ requires a covered clearing 
agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies 
and procedures reasonably designed to maintain a sound risk management 
framework for comprehensively managing legal, credit, liquidity, 
operational, general business, investment, custody, and other risks 
that arise in or are borne by the covered clearing agency, which 
includes, inter alia, (i) risk management policies, procedures, and 
systems designed to identify, measure, monitor, and manage the range of 
risks that arise in or are borne by the covered clearing agency, that 
are subject to review on a specified periodic basis and approved by the 
LCH SA Board annually; and (ii) plans for the recovery and orderly 
wind-down of the covered clearing agency necessitated by credit losses, 
liquidity shortfalls, losses from general business risk, or any other 
losses.\126\

    \125\ 17 CFR 240.17ad-22(e)(3).
    \126\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In this regard, the RGF is a framework that: (i) identifies and 
categorizes Key Risks faced by LCH SA; (ii) sets out the roles and 
responsibilities within LCH SA for managing each identified Key Risk; 
(iii) provides the standards to be met by LCH SA when managing its 
business activities within the determined risk appetite; and (iv) 
establishes the indicators and tolerance thresholds by which each Key 
Risk is meant to be measured and reported. For example, and as noted 
above, the RGF identifies the standards that are specific

[[Page 36267]]

to LCH SA in relation to the subject of RRW to ensure LCH SA has a 
proper recovery plan to handle a loss event, remain solvent and 
continue to operate smoothly in performing its central clearing role. 
The RGF also expects that the LCH SA Board establish a wind-down plan 
for non-critical services, to be tested annually and on a selected 
service. The RGF is signed off by the LCH SA Board at least annually. 
By providing (i) an overall risk management framework to 
comprehensively manage the Key Risks, subject to the LCH SA Board's 
annual review and sign-off; and (ii) a plan for the recovery and 
orderly wind-down of LCH SA, the RGF is consistent with Commission Rule 
17ad-22(e)(3).\127\

    Commission Rule 17ad-22(e)(4)(i) requires a covered clearing agency 
to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and 
procedures reasonably designed to effectively identify, measure, 
monitor, and manage its credit exposures to participants and those 
arising from its payment, clearing, and settlement processes by 
maintaining sufficient financial resources to cover its credit exposure 
to each participant fully with a high degree of confidence.\128\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \128\ 17 CFR 240.17ad-22(e)(4)(i).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The CCRP sets out the standards by which LCH SA manages and 
assesses counterparty credit risk. Specifically, the policy requires 
LCH SA Credit Risk to assign an ICS to: (i) all clearing members and 
the sovereign of their country of risk (and that of their parent, if 
different); and (ii) all counterparties, including intermediaries and 
countries which are subject to a minimum ICS as covered in other risk 
policies. In addition, the CCRP imposes credit exposure monitoring 
thresholds, limits and tolerances on each clearing member. the CCRP 
ensures LCH SA maintains sufficient financial resources (including 
prefunded financial resources) to cover its credit exposure to each 
participant by: (i) assigning an ICS to each counterparty based on an 
assessment of quantitative and qualitative factors; and (ii) detailing 
the policy on exposure monitoring thresholds, limits and tolerances 
applicable to each clearing member. The CCRP is therefore consistent 
with Commission Rules 17ad-22(e)(4)(i).\129\

    Commission Rule 17ad-22(e)(4)(iii) requires a covered clearing 
agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies 
and procedures reasonably designed to effectively identify, measure, 
monitor, and manage its credit exposures to participants and those 
arising from its payment, clearing, and settlement processes, including 
by maintaining additional financial resources at the minimum to enable 
it to cover a wide range of foreseeable stress scenarios that include, 
but are not limited to, the default of the participant family that 
would potentially cause the largest aggregate credit exposure for the 
covered clearing agency in extreme but plausible market 
conditions.\130\ In addition, Commission Rule 17ad-22(e)(4)(v) requires 
that such financial resources be maintained in combined or separately 
maintained clearing or guarantee funds.\131\

    The FRAP describes the standards governing the assessment of 
financial resources (initial margins, margin add-ons and default funds) 
against Latent Market Risks in clearing portfolios at LCH SA. 
Specifically, the policy requires additional margins to be held (where 
appropriate) to cover member specific portfolio risk arising from house 
and client activity of the following types: (i) concentration/liquidity 
risk; (ii) sovereign risk; (iii) wrong way risk; and (iv) counterparty 
credit risk. The FRAP details the stress regime to be used to identify 
`extreme but plausible' tail losses in each member portfolio beyond the 
applicable initial margin confidence level. For instance, it requires 
liquidity stress tests, collateral stress tests, and exposure stress 
tests to be run daily. The policy also details the maximum credit 
tolerances to be applied per LCH SA clearing member every day. By 
confirming: (i) the requirements for LCH SA to impose, call and collect 
daily margins; (ii) the methodology for stress testing; and (iii) the 
allocation of financial resources per clearing member, the FRAP is 
consistent with Commission Rules 17ad-22(e)(4)(iii) \132\ and 17ad-
22(e)(4)(v).\133\

monitor, and manage its credit-exposures to participants and those 
arising from its payment, clearing, and settlement processes, including 
testing the sufficiency of its total financial resources available to 
meet its minimum financial resource requirements by: (i) conducting 
stress testing of its total financial resources once each day using 
standard predetermined parameters and assumptions; (ii) conducting a 
comprehensive analysis on at least a monthly basis of the existing 
stress testing scenarios, models, and underlying parameters and 
assumptions, and considering modifications to ensure they are 
appropriate for determining the covered clearing agency's required 
level of default protection in light of current and evolving market

scenarios, models, and underlying parameters and assumptions more 
frequently than monthly when the products cleared or markets served 
display high volatility or become less liquid, or when the size or 
concentration of positions held by the covered clearing agency's 
participants increases significantly; and (iv) reporting the results of 
its analyses under items (ii) and (iii) above to appropriate decision 
makers at the covered clearing agency, including but not limited to, 
its Risk Management Committee or LCH SA Board, and using these results 
to evaluate the adequacy of and adjust its margin methodology, model 
parameters, models used to generate clearing or guaranty fund 
requirements, and any other relevant aspects of its credit risk 
management framework, in supporting compliance with the minimum 
financial resources requirements set forth in paragraphs (e)(4)(i) and 
(iii) of this section.\135\

    The FRAP (i) details the standards by which financial resources 
should be assessed against member exposures; (ii) details the holding 
periods to be used for each product in the assessment of margins, 
providing justification for each; (iii) articulates the predefined 
stress regime to be used by LCH SA to identify `extreme but plausible' 
tail losses in each member portfolio beyond the applicable initial 
margin confidence level; (iv) sets the standards to be used for reverse 
stress testing the financial resources held against member positions; 
and (v) establishes the required daily liquidity stress, collateral 
stress and exposure stress testing. The policy also details a 
comprehensive process for LCH SA to monitor, analyze and resize each 
default fund on a monthly basis.
    The FRAP also complements the Model Governance, Validation and 
Review Policy by adding further standards to be included in the testing 
and validation of margin models. For instance, it requires LCH SA to 
(i) list and justify its critical model assumptions and modelling 
methodology; and (ii) calculate and

[[Page 36268]]

monitor the sensitivities of model outputs to key parameter changes. 
Moreover, the FRAP provides that the appropriateness of the policy 
relative to the LCH SA Board's risk appetite and regulatory 
requirements should be reviewed on an annual basis by ERCo with any 
significant findings reported to the LCH SA Risk Committee and LCH SA 
Board. The FRAP is therefore consistent with Commission Rule 17ad-
22(e)(4)(vi).\136\

    Commission Rule 17ad-22(e)(5) \137\ requires a covered clearing 
agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies 
and procedures reasonably designed to limit the assets it accepts as 
collateral to those with low credit, liquidity, and market risks, and 
set and enforce appropriately conservative haircuts and concentration 
limits if the covered clearing agency requires collateral to manage its 
or its participants' credit exposures.

    The CRP sets out the standards for the management of LCH SA's 
collateral risks. As noted above, the policy identifies the acceptance 
criteria for cash and non-cash collateral posted by its members to 
cover margin requirements and default fund contributions to those with 
low credit, liquidity and market risks. With regards to cash, as 
explained in the CRP and noted above, LCH SA limits the primary 
currencies accepted by LCH SA to EUR, GBP, and USD. In relation to non-
cash collateral, the policy limits the assets to certain traded 
securities and central bank guarantees. Moreover, the CRP requires LCH 
SA to apply a defined haircut methodology and mandates additional 
haircuts and concentration limits to manage its or its participants' 
credit exposures when certain events are triggered. For instance, 
issuers are subject to a credit risk add-on where they are assigned an 
ICS of four or below.
    By confirming (i) the principles and factors that will be applied 
when considering whether an asset can be accepted by LCH SA as 
collateral for margin cover; and (ii) the base haircuts, haircut add-
ons, limits and/or price adjustments, the CRP is consistent with 
Commission Rule 17ad-22(e)(5).\138\

    Commission Rule 17ad-22(e)(6) \139\ requires a covered clearing 
agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies 
and procedures reasonably designed to cover, if the covered clearing 
agency provides central counterparty services, its credit exposures to 
its participants by establishing a risk-based margin system that, at a 
minimum, inter alia: (i) considers, and produces margin levels 
commensurate with, the risks and particular attributes of each relevant 
product, portfolio, and market; (ii) marks participant positions to 
market and collects margin, including variation margin or equivalent 
charges if relevant, at least daily and includes the authority and 
operational capacity to make intraday margin calls in defined 
circumstances; (iii) uses reliable sources of timely price data and 
uses procedures and sound valuation models for addressing circumstances 
in which pricing data are not readily available or reliable; and (iv) 
uses an appropriate method for measuring credit exposure that accounts 
for relevant product risk factors and portfolio effects across 
products.

    The FRAP sets out the standards governing the assessment of 
financial resources (initial margins, margin add-ons and default funds) 
against the Latent Market Risks in clearing member portfolios at LCH 
SA. As noted above, the FRAP requires LCH SA to impose, call and 
collect margins at least daily on each day when its Clearing Services 
are open and operating to limit its credit exposures to its clearing 
members and, where relevant, from CCPs with which it has 
interoperability arrangements. In addition, the policy sets out the LCH 
SA standards for initial margin, margin add-ons, intraday margins and 
variation margin. For instance, additional margins must be held (where 
appropriate) to cover member specific portfolio risk arising from both 
house and client activity of the following types: (i) concentration/
liquidity risk; (ii) sovereign risk; (iii) wrong way risk; and (iv) 
counterparty credit risk. In addition, each Clearing Service is 
expected to monitor margin levels intraday and to have the capacity to 
call for margin intraday should it be necessary to address any issues 
with member exposures. The FRAP also details the standard for the 
calculation of margin, including the methods of price capture and 
verification.
    By confirming: (i) the policy requiring LCH SA to impose, call and 
collect daily margins; (ii) the methods for calculating margins; and 
(iii) the ability for Clearing Services to call for intraday margin, 
where necessary, the FRAP is consistent with Commission Rule 17ad-
22(e)(6).\140\

    Commission Rule 17ad-22(e)(18) requires a covered clearing agency 
to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and 
procedures reasonably designed to establish objective, risk-based, and 
publicly disclosed criteria for participation, which, inter alia: (i) 
require participants to have sufficient financial resources and robust 
operational capacity to meet obligations arising from participation in 
the clearing agency; and (ii) monitor compliance with such 
participation requirements on an ongoing basis.\141\

    The CCRP describes the standards by which LCH SA manages and 
assesses counterparty credit risk via an ICS and limit frameworks. In 
addition to clarifying the roles and responsibilities within LCH SA for 
compliance with the policy, noted above, the CCRP requires LCH SA 
Credit Risk to: (i) assign and maintain the ICS for each counterparty; 
(ii) assign, maintain and monitor the applicable limits under the 
policy; (iii) report to the responsible risk team of any change in the 
ICS which triggers actions under the CCRP and other LCH SA risk 
policies; and (iv) provide regular and ad-hoc reporting to other risk 
areas and senior management. The CCRP requires an ICS to be assigned to 
all clearing members and the sovereign of their country of risk (and 
that of their parent, if different); and all other counterparties, 
including intermediaries and countries which are subject to a minimum 
ICS as covered in other risk policies. Furthermore, the CCRP sets out 
the factors used by LCH SA to assign an ICS and Implied ICS for each of 
the counterparty types it deals with. The CCRP also details the 
exposure monitoring thresholds, limits and tolerances applied to each 
clearing member; all thresholds are monitored daily, and LCH SA Credit 
Risk decide on any action to be taken when a breach has occurred.
    By providing for the assignment, maintenance and monitoring of an 
ICS applied to each counterparty that LCH SA interacts with, as well as 
the monitoring of related counterparty credit risk thresholds, the CCRP 
is consistent with Commission Rule 17ad-22(e)(18).\142\

    Commission Rule 17ad-25(i) requires a covered clearing agency to 
manage risks from relationships with its service providers for core 
services.\143\ The TPRMP states that LCH SA consider a risk-based and 
proportionate approach to onboarding third parties (including service 
providers for core services). LCH SA adopts the highest level of 
oversight and due diligence for critical third party services. Third 
parties deemed critical in accordance with the TPRMP will

[[Page 36269]]

have a high or very-high inherent risk rating and require more 
heightened due diligence (monitoring and testing) and approval by the 
LCH SA Board for any changes to the relationship with any critical 
third party engagements. By considering this risks borne from its 
relationships with service providers of core services and applying a 
more stringent due diligence process for such service providers, LCH SA 
believes its TPRMP is consistent with Commission Rule 17ad-25(i).\144\

    Rule 1001 of Regulation System Compliance and Integrity (``Reg 
SCI'') \145\ requires SCI entities (which include registered clearing 
agencies), to: (i) establish, maintain, and enforce written policies 
and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that its SCI systems and, 
for purposes of security standards, indirect SCI systems, have levels 
of capacity, integrity, resiliency, availability, and security, 
adequate to maintain the SCI entity's operational capability and 
promote the maintenance of fair and orderly markets; and (ii) 
establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures 
reasonably designed to ensure that its SCI systems operate in a manner 
that complies with the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and 
the entity's rules and governing documents, as applicable.

    The ORMP sets out (i) LCH SA's appetite and expectations for the 
management of operational risk (defined as the risk of loss arising 
from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or 
from external events); and (ii) the key features of the operational 
risk management framework for identifying, assessing, monitoring, 
mitigating and managing operational risk. In addition to clarifying the 
roles and responsibilities within LCH SA for compliance with the 
policy, noted above, the ORMP requires LCH SA to have a defined risk 
taxonomy for operational risks, and sets out the risk assessment tools 
and processes to be used, including RCAs, control assurance processes, 
and deep dives. Furthermore, the ORMP details the process to be 
followed when the following risk events occur triggering a re-
assessment of risks and controls: (i) incidents and actual losses; (ii) 
audit or risk and compliance issues, and external reviews; (iii) key 
risk and control indicator breaches; (iv) control weakness; (v) other 
internal events including process changes or restructuring; and (vi) 
external events arising outside of LCH SA and LCH Group's control 
(e.g., natural disasters, pandemics, political changes, etc.).
    By providing for the overall operational risk management framework 
of LCH SA, including the controls detailed thereunder, the ORMP is 
designed to ensure that LCH SA's systems and indirect systems have 
levels of capacity, integrity, resiliency, availability, and security, 
adequate to maintain LCH SA's operational capability and ensure that 
its systems operate in a manner that complies with the Act and the 
rules and regulations thereunder. The ORMP is therefore consistent with 
Rule 1001 of Reg SCI.\146\

B. Clearing Agency's Statement on Burden on Competition

    Section 17A(b)(3)(I) of the Act requires that the rules of a 
clearing agency not impose any burden on competition not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.\147\ LCH SA does 
not believe the Risk Policies would have any impact or impose any 
burden on competition. The Risk Policies do not address any competitive 
issue or have any significant impact on the competition among central 
counterparties. LCH SA operates an open access clearing model, and the 
Risk Policies will have no direct effect on this access model subject 
to the regulatory requirements, our clearing rules provisions and our 
governance process on the clearing membership criteria and eligibility 
including the appropriate credit risk assessment.
