      <description>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is proposing to reinstate the full exclusion on abortions and abortion counseling from the medical benefits package, which was removed in 2022. Before that time, this exclusion had been firmly in place since the medical benefits package was first established in 1999. VA is also proposing to reinstate the exclusions on abortion and abortion counseling for Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA) that were removed in 2022. We take this action to ensure that VA provides only needed medical services to our nation&amp;#39;s heroes and their families.</description>

      <title>Modification and Revocation of Class E Airspace; Hawaiian Island, HI</title>

      <description>This action proposes to modify the Class E airspace area extending upward from 700 feet above the surface (Class E5 700-foot airspace area) at Lihue Airport (LIH), Lihue, HI; Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL), Honolulu, HI; and Ellison Onizuka Kona International Airport, Keahole (KOA), Kailua-Kona, HI, by adding an additional layer of Class E5 airspace extending upward from 1,200 feet above the surface. This proposed addition of controlled airspace would comply with international airspace treaty provisions and satisfy the State of Hawaii&amp;#39;s domestic airspace requirements. Additionally, this action proposes to remove the existing Class E5 airspace area that currently encompasses the Hawaiian Islands and extends beyond 12 miles from the shoreline into international airspace. This proposed action would further modify the Class E4 airspace area designated as an extension to a Class D or Class E surface area at KOA and remove the Class E4 airspace area at LIH. These actions support the safe and efficient management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at airports within the Hawaiian Islands.</description>

      <description>NOAA will hold two virtual public hearings, on September 3, 2025, and on September 4, 2025, to receive oral comments on the July 7, 2025, proposed rule for revisions to the Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act (DSHMRA or the Act) regulations. DSHMRA charges NOAA with the responsibility for issuing licenses for exploration and permits for commercial recovery of polymetallic nodules from the deep seabed in areas beyond national jurisdiction and promulgating regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act. Additionally, the Act requires that NOAA hold a public hearing for proposed changes to the DSHMRA regulations. The July 7, 2025, proposed rule noted that NOAA will hold one virtual public hearing on the proposed changes to the DSHMRA regulations on a date, time, and virtual location to be determined, which will be published in the Federal Register and posted on NOAA&amp;#39;s Deep Seabed Mining website.</description>

      <title>Remove Regulations for Sulphur Operations</title>
      <link>https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/08/01/2025-14618/remove-regulations-for-sulphur-operations</link>
      <description>The Department of the Interior (DOI or Department), through the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), is rescinding the majority of the provisions in its sulphur operations subpart and revising the subpart by applying other available regulatory requirements for similar operations to sulphur operations in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The existing regulations are outdated, duplicative of, or inconsistent with, other Department regulations. This direct final rule provides consistency and clarity to industry regarding regulatory requirements for sulphur operations by aligning the requirements with the Department&amp;#39;s other BSEE-administered regulations.</description>

      <description>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is proposing to designate safety and security information, reports, data, and work products provided to the FAA from the U.S. Aviation Safety Team (USAST) and its membership as protected from public disclosure. The FAA is authorized to protect voluntarily provided safety and security information from disclosure. This proposed designation is intended to encourage the sharing of information between the FAA and the aviation industry during the discovery of system-level safety issues in the National Airspace System (NAS) and the development and implementation of safety enhancements to address these issues. The voluntarily provided information described in this proposed designation is critical to the FAA&amp;#39;s safety mission because it supports a proactive and collaborative, data-driven strategy to reduce the risk of fatal and non-fatal accidents.</description>

      <title>Reconsideration of 2009 Endangerment Finding and Greenhouse Gas Vehicle Standards</title>

      <description>In this action, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to repeal all greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards for light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty vehicles and engines to effectuate the best reading of Clean Air Act (CAA) section 202(a). We propose that CAA section 202(a) does not authorize the EPA to prescribe emission standards to address global climate change concerns and, on that basis, propose to rescind the Administrator&amp;#39;s prior findings in 2009 that GHG emissions from new motor vehicles and engines contribute to air pollution which may endanger public health or welfare. We further propose, in the alternative, to rescind the Administrator&amp;#39;s prior findings in 2009 because the EPA unreasonably analyzed the scientific record and because developments cast significant doubt on the reliability of the findings. Lastly, we propose to repeal all GHG emission standards on the alternative bases that no requisite technology for vehicle and engine emission control can address the global climate change concerns identified in the findings without risking greater harms to public health and welfare.</description>

      <description>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) invites public comment on one currently-approved Information Collection Request (ICR), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number 1652-0056, abstracted below, that we will submit to OMB for an extension in compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA).

The collection allows TSA to assess the current security practices in the pipeline industry through TSA&amp;#39;s Pipeline Corporate Security Review (CSR) program and allows for the continuation of mandatory cybersecurity requirements under the TSA Security Directive (SD) Pipeline--2021-02 series.</description>
